# PRNTSCRN
A screenshot tool not too dissimilar from the F2 screenshot key from Minecraft!

Features include:
- Screenshotting levels without your UI clutter! (Or your player!)
- Copy to clipboard!
- Automatic screenshots every `n`% or every `n` seconds when playing a level!
- Customizable screenshot dimensions! (For those who prefer doing things that way.)
- Saving screenshots as JPG!
- Rebindable keybinds!
- An API for other mods to take screenshots through this mod!

This is currently a desktop-only mod. If anyone has any ideas on how to copy image data to the clipboard on Android and iOS, good luck.
