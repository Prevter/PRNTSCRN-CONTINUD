# PRNTSCRN
A screenshot tool not too dissimilar from the F2 screenshot key from Minecraft!

Tired of reaching for that clunky three-key shortcut to screenshot things? Disgusted by the window shadows from macOS screenshots? Finding it tedious to hide that one specific node via DevTools?

Let PRNTSCRN make that screenshotting process easier for you!

Features include:
- Screenshotting levels without your UI clutter! (Or your player!)
- Copy to clipboard!
- Automatic screenshots every `n`% or every `n` seconds when playing a level!
- Customizable screenshot dimensions! (For those who prefer doing things that way.)
- Saving screenshots as JPG!
- Rebindable keybinds!
- An API for other mods to take screenshots through this mod!

This is currently a desktop-only mod.
