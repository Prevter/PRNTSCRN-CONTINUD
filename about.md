A screenshot tool not too dissimilar from the F2 screenshot key from Minecraft!

Tired of reaching for that clunky three-key shortcut to screenshot things? Disgusted by the window shadows from macOS screenshots? Finding it tedious to hide that one specific node via DevTools?

Let <cy>PRNTSCRN</c> make that screenshotting process easier for you!

Featuring:
- Screenshotting levels without your UI clutter! (Or your player!)
- Automatic screenshots every `n`% or every `n` seconds when playing a level!
- Customizable screenshot dimensions! (For those who prefer doing things that way.)
- Eclipse Menu integration!
- An API for other mods to take screenshots through this mod!
- Rebindable keybinds! (macOS, Windows, and iOS only)
- Copy to clipboard! (macOS/Windows only)
- Saving screenshots as JPG! (macOS/Windows only)

## Special Thanks
- <c-ff6666>mat</c> for the original screenshot mod idea; without it, none of this would've been possible.
- <c-00ff00>nin</c><c-2222ff>X</c><c-00ff00>out</c> for fleshing out this mod even further while he still could, and adding macOS support.
- <c-7d7dff>Prev</c><c-ffa040>ter</c> for help in writing the API for this mod, as well as generously lending his C++ expertise and his [ImagePlus API](mod:prevter.imageplus) to make iOS/Android support possible.
